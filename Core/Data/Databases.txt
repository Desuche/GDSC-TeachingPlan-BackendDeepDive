Teaching Plan for "Databases" - Core Level

Class Duration: 50 minutes

Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the concept of databases and their role in storing and managing data.
2. Learn about different types of databases, including SQL, NoSQL, and column store databases.
3. Explore the characteristics, use cases, and advantages of each type of database.
4. Provide an optional activity for a simple Google Cloud-based database exercise.

Step-by-Step Approach:

1. Introduction to Databases (5 minutes)
   - Begin the class by explaining the concept of databases and their importance in managing data.
   - Discuss how databases are used to store and organize structured or unstructured data.
   - Highlight the role of databases in various applications, such as web development, e-commerce, and data analytics.

2. Types of Databases (15 minutes)
   - Introduce the different types of databases, focusing on SQL, NoSQL, and column store databases.
   - Explain the key characteristics and differences between these types.
   - Discuss the structured nature of SQL databases, the flexible schema of NoSQL databases, and the column-oriented storage of column store databases.

3. SQL Databases (10 minutes)
   - Explain the concept of SQL (Structured Query Language) databases.
   - Discuss the relational model and the use of tables, rows, and columns.
   - Highlight the advantages of SQL databases, such as ACID compliance and strong data consistency.
   - Provide examples of popular SQL database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

4. NoSQL Databases (10 minutes)
   - Introduce the concept of NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases.
   - Discuss the flexible schema and the ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data.
   - Explain different types of NoSQL databases, such as document-based, key-value, columnar, and graph databases.
   - Provide examples of popular NoSQL database systems, such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

5. Column Store Databases (10 minutes)
   - Explain the concept of column store databases.
   - Discuss the column-oriented storage model and the benefits it provides for analytical queries.
   - Highlight the advantages of column store databases, such as better compression, query performance, and data aggregation.
   - Provide examples of popular column store database systems, such as Apache Cassandra and Google Bigtable.

Optional Activity - Google Cloud-based Database Exercise (25 minutes)
   - Provide a simple exercise that involves setting up and interacting with a Google Cloud-based database.
   - Guide students through the process of creating a database instance using a service like Cloud Firestore or Cloud SQL.
   - Demonstrate how to perform basic operations, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying the database.
   - Encourage students to explore the features and functionality of the database service.
   - Allow students to work individually or in pairs, depending on class size and preference.
   - Provide support and guidance as needed, answering questions and clarifying doubts.

6. Recap and Conclusion (5 minutes)
   - Summarize the key concepts covered in the class, including the different types of databases (SQL, NoSQL, and column store).
   - Emphasize the importance of understanding the characteristics and use cases of each type of database.
   - Encourage students to explore further resources and practice using different types of databases to enhance their skills.

Note: This teaching plan is designed for a 50-minute class. Adjustments can be made based on the pace and progress of the students. The optional activity can be conducted either during the class or as a post-class exercise, depending on the availability of resources and time constraints.
