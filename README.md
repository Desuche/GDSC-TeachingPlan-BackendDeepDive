# GDSC-TeachingPlan-BackendDeepDive
This is a teaching plan for the HKBU Google Developer Student Club's Backend Deep Dive Program


## Overview
This repository contains detailed teaching plans for various levels of classes focusing on backend technologies. The classes are structured into three levels: Prerequisites, Core, and Advanced. The recommended learning path is to start with the Prerequisites, then progress to the Core, and finally move on to the Advanced level.

## Structure of Teaching Plans
Each teaching plan follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and effectiveness in delivering the content. The teaching plans are designed to be approximately 50 minutes in duration, providing a comprehensive overview of the topic while allowing room for interactive learning and exercises.

The teaching plans include the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the topic and its relevance in the context of backend technologies.

2. **Learning Objectives**: Clearly outlines the intended learning outcomes for the class.

3. **Step-by-Step Approach**: Presents a detailed breakdown of the class, highlighting the key concepts, explaining the step-by-step approach to teaching the topic, and allocating time for each section.

4. **Recap and Conclusion**: Summarizes the key takeaways from the class and encourages further exploration of resources.

## Recommended Learning Path
To ensure a comprehensive understanding of backend technologies, it is recommended to follow the suggested learning path:

1. **Prerequisites**: Start with the Prerequisites level to gain a foundational understanding of backend concepts and technologies.

2. **Core**: Progress to the Core level, which provides in-depth coverage of fundamental backend topics and includes practical coding exercises to reinforce learning.

3. **Advanced**: Finally, move on to the Advanced level, which covers advanced topics not covered in the Core level. These classes focus on high-level concepts and provide a broader perspective on backend technologies.

Following this learning path will enable students to build a strong foundation, gradually develop their skills, and explore advanced concepts at their own pace.


## Tech Stacks 
This is a non exhaustive, tentative list of technologies that will be used in our practical sessions.

1. **Programming Language**: 

- JavaScript

JavaScript is widely adopted and versatile, making it an ideal choice for backend development.
Students will gain a solid foundation in a language that can be applied to various backend projects.


2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services**:

- Google Cloud Databases:

Enables students to work with managed database services, such as Google Cloud SQL or Firestore.
Students will learn how to design and interact with databases, perform CRUD operations, and ensure data integrity.

- Firebase:

Offers a comprehensive suite of backend services, including real-time database, authentication, and hosting.
Students will gain hands-on experience in building backend functionalities like user authentication and real-time updates.
